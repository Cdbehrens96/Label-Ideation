This repository is for all holders of a GEIST CLUB Membership Card or the 
GSTC token to directly request features or communicate with other members 
via issues. 

Using the powco.dev suite and the BoostPOW protocol, these issues and 
requests can be attached to a costly signal, letting all members know what 
we should be focused on for development.
